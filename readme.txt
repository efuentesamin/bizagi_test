Vacations Approval App

As requested, the app shows a list of vacation requests. The user can tap on any row to approve or unapprove the task.

In the navigation bar there is an add button to show a form for insert a new vacation request.

The API behind the app is powered by sheetsu.com which can convert a Google Sheet into a fully functional REST API.

The Google Sheet in this case is:
